# CDCL(Crypto)

CDCL(Crypto) is a CDCL SAT solver for cryptanalysis problems (inspired by the
CDCL(T) paradigm in SMT solvers). It uses a programmatic SAT design to extend
the logical reasoning components of a SAT solver (propagation and conflict
analysis) with domain-specific knowledge about the cryptographic primitives
being analyzed by the solver. The base solver used in this project is MapleSAT.
